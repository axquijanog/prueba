Project Task  
=============

This module extends the functionality of Odoo's ``project`` module by adding a custom menu called **User Tasks**, which provides three specific views to help users and administrators manage tasks more efficiently.

Features
--------

- üìå **My Tasks**: Displays only the tasks assigned to the currently logged-in user.
- üëÅÔ∏è **All Tasks**: Available to administrators only. Shows all tasks in the system, along with their statuses and assignees.
- üîç **User Tasks**: Allows viewing and editing of a specific user's personal task view.

Menu
----

This module adds a new menu to the system:
